# Projects under the track of Data Scientist with Python


Currently, I am pursuing a career track provided by the datacamp. The track is named as "Data Scientist with Python".

The track consists of 24 short to medium length courses alongwith mini-project.

In this repository, all the miniprojects done by me as a part of the track will be commited.
